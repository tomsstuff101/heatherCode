# heatherCode

A rough HTML/CSS clone of [Heather Gems](https://www.heathergems.com/) as an exersise.

Fonts, colours and design features such as fontawsome CSS close to original to get a reasonable facsimile of the real site. 

With more time I could have finished off the nav bar and footer details, as well as included media queries for responsive design.
